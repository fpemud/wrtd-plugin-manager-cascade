VPN is only a technical method, the importance is the service provided.

There's 2 methods for the client to use VPN:
1. ALL: Client make the default route point to VPN, and use VPN's name server.
        So that client can use all the service provided by VPN.
3. CASCADE: Don't use VPN's default route and name server.
            Get information from CASCADE-API, add route for all the lan-prefixes, add dnsmasq entry or /etc/hosts entry for all the CASCADE-clients
            So that client can join the VPN, and choose which service to use on its own.
